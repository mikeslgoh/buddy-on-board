51,PER,Agent used for RSVP commands from the server to the Persistence Agent.
52,Persistence Agent,"A software that is installed in the operating system (as a service) of thedevice. The agent makes regularly scheduled calls over the Internet to the Monitoring Center andprovides data gathered about the device. The agent also manages the Absolute “helperapplications” to support activities like Data Delete security actions or to aid in theft recovery.The agent is small and lightweight, but it is not easy to remove and cannot be removed manuallywhen Persistence® technology is enabled"
53,Persistence Module,"This module is installed at the factory in the firmware of many desktop, laptop,tablet, and smartphone devices. Each device leaves the factory with the Persistence module inplace, waiting to be activated. After you install the agent on the device, the Persistence moduleis activated when the agent makes its first call to the Monitoring Center.Persistence technology restores the agent if it is missing, tampered with, or removed. For example,if a thief steals a laptop and reinstalls the operating system, Persistence technology restores theagent."

65,SIEM,"Security Information and Event ManagementMost SIEM vendors we’ve worked with on integration want us to do the data mapping from our events to their templates.  When that is the case, we simply map our ‘generic’ event details to the appropriate fields and that’s the end of it.LogRhythm approaches data integration very differently.  They don’t allow partners to simply map data; instead LogRhythm Labs takes sample event data that relates to varies types of alert info and integrates it within their algorithms for a more actionable, intelligent parsing of the data.  For that reason, they want to understand not just our event structure, but more information on the different kinds of event data we might be sending so they can add it to their correlation algorithms and attempt to ‘extract’ more intelligence out of the data.McAfee ESM wants insight into our event types for a different reason.  They are pushing hard for all McAfee products to leverage DXL (which they just announced would be an open standard for secure communications).  We can integrate with their SIEM in various ways: DXL, ePO APIs, syslog raw data or another proprietary protocol.  McAfee is interested in understanding the information behind our events in order to best suggest which path we should take to do the integration that will most benefit all McAfee products over time."
